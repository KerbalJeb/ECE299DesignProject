	abstract = {We obtained data on the lengths, girths, and diameters of the fingers of children from 3 to 10 years of age. A total of 160 children (78 girls, 82 boys) were examined in a cross-sectional investigation. The length of each finger of the right hand of every child was measured, as were the girths of the proximal, middle, and distal phalanges, and of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joint. The average length of the thumb was 49 (35-65) mm. The index and ring fingers both averaged 69 (index, 50-88; ring, 42-96) mm in length, while the middle and little fingers averaged 72 (57-100) and 56 (40-74) mm, respectively. Average diameter, calculated from the girth measurement, was 16 (11-22) mm for the thumb, 15 mm for both the index (9-22) and middle (10-21) fingers, 14 (10-20) and 13 (8-19) mm for the ring and little fingers, respectively. The average length of each finger increased by 37\% from 3 to 10 years of age, average girth by 24\%, and diameter increased by 20\%. We observed no differences in length, girth, and diameter between the sexes. The dimensions of children's fingers are relevant to injuries from automatic, power-operated window lifters of motor vehicles because risk of injury to a finger jammed between an ascending window and the seal entry depends upon the diameter of the finger. Additionally, short fingers of young children can be jammed over almost their entire length in the oblique design of a car window seal entry.},
